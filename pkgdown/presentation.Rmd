## What is `datelife`?

`datelife` is an R package that allows researchers and the general audience to obtain
open scientific data on the age of any organism they are interested in.
`datelife` retrieves organism ages from a database of dated phylogenetic trees (chronograms), which
have been peer-reviewed and published in association with a scientific research
article in an indexed journal ([Open Tree of Life's tree store](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator)).
As such, these organism ages constitute state-of-the-art,
peer-reviewed, public scientific knowledge, that can be accessed and reused by
experts and non-experts in the field alike.

## How can you use `datelife`?

You can install the `datelife` R package on your own computer and use it locally.

If you do not want to deal with installation, you can go to
[DateLife's interactive website application](http://datelife.opentreeoflife.org/query/).
