# Welcome to DateLife’s R package documentation!

## What is `datelife`?

`datelife` is an R package that allows researchers and the general
audience to obtain open scientific data on the age of any organism they
are interested in. `datelife` retrieves organism ages from a database of
dated phylogenetic trees (chronograms), which have been peer-reviewed
and published in association with a scientific research article in an
indexed journal ([Open Tree of Life’s tree
store](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator)). As such, these
organism ages constitute state-of-the-art, peer-reviewed, public
scientific knowledge, that can be accessed and reused by experts and
non-experts in the field alike.

## How can you use `datelife`?

You can install the `datelife` R package on your own computer and use it
locally.

If you do not want to deal with installation, you can go to [DateLife’s
interactive website
application](http://datelife.opentreeoflife.org/query/).
