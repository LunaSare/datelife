# Welcome to DateLife's R package GitHub repository!

Get a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths proportional to geologic time (aka a
_**chronogram**_) of any two or more lineages of interest to you.

Use the `datelife` R package locally, or through [DateLife's website](http://datelife.org/query/) to search for chronograms available for your lineages in [Open Tree of Life's tree store](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator).

You can also date a phylogenetic tree of your own making (or choosing one from the literature), using node ages from chronograms found with `datelife`, using the congruification method ([Eastman et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12051))
implemented with _geiger_ ([Harmon et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btm538)).

`datelife` has been developed as part of the [phylotastic](http://phylotastic.org/) (NSF-funded) project, and is still under development.

1. [Installation](#installation)
1. [Citation](#citation)
1. [Feedback and info for developers](#feedback)
1. [License](#license)


## 1. Installation

Once accepted on CRAN, `datelife`s stable version will be available for installation with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("datelife")
```

For now, you can install the development version from the GitHub repository:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("phylotastic/datelife")
```

## 2. Citation

If you use `datelife` for a publication, please cite the R package and the accompanying paper:

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
print(citation("datelife"), bibtex = FALSE, style = "html")
```

You can get these citations and the bibtex entry with:
```{r eval = FALSE}
citation("datelife")
toBibtex(citation("datelife"))
```

.bibtex files are available

## 3. Feedback and Information for Developers

We welcome and encourage to post a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/phylotastic/datelife/issues/new)
with any comments, ideas and questions about `datelife`'s software and website.
If you want to contribute with code directly, we welcome and encourage [pull requests](https://github.com/phylotastic/datelife/pulls).

#### Function documentation:

Package and function documentation was generated with [roxygen2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=roxygen2):

```{r eval = FALSE}
roxygen2::roxygenise()
```

#### Styling code:

We used the package [lintr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lintr) to check for coding style:

```{r eval = FALSE}
lintr::lint_package()
```

#### Calculating test coverage:

Code coverage was calculated with the package [covr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=covr):

```{r eval = FALSE}
cov <- covr::package_coverage()

usethis::use_data(cov, overwrite = TRUE)
```

You can see an interactive report of testing coverage:

```{r eval = FALSE}
covr::report(cov)
```

And, find code with zero coverage:

```{r eval = FALSE}
covr::zero_coverage(cov)
```

#### Releasing to CRAN:

To be able to release to CRAN, the first step is to pass a check. To run a local check, you can use the command `R CMD check` from your
terminal. For that, change directories to the one above your working clone of the `datelife` repo:

``` bash
cd ../
```

Generate a tar ball for your package by running `R CMD build package-name`:

``` bash
R CMD build datelife
```

Finally, run `R CMD check package-tar-ball` on the tar ball that you just generated:

``` bash
R CMD check datelife_0.6.0.tar.gz
```

The best option to document your checks currently is the [rhub](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rhub) package, which allows remote testing on several OS with:


```bash
rhub::check_for_cran()
```

#### Generating `datelife`'s hexsticker:

Code used to generate current `datelife`'s logo hexsticker is in [data-raw/hexsticker-current.R](data-raw/hexsticker-current.R)

#### Rendering the vignettes:

```{r eval = FALSE}
knitr::knit("vignettes/Getting_started_with_datelife.Rmd")
```
