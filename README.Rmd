# Welcome to DateLife's GitHub repository!

Get a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths proportional to geologic time (aka a
_**chronogram**_) of any two or more lineages of interest to you: use the `datelife`
R package or go to [www.datelife.org](http://datelife.org/query/) to make
a query of chronograms available for your lineages in the [Open Tree of Life](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator)'s
tree store.

You can also date a phylogenetic tree of your own making (or choosing one from the literature), using node ages from chronograms queried with `datelife`
and the congruification method ([Eastman et al. 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12051/abstract))
implemented with _geiger_ ([Harmon et al. 2008](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/1/129.short)).


`datelife` has been developed as part of the [phylotastic](http://phylotastic.org/) (NSF-funded) project, and is still under rapid development.

- [Citation](#citation)
- [Feedback and info for developers](#feedback)
- [License](#license)


## Installation

Get the stable version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datelife/index.html):

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("datelife")
```

Or, install the development version from the GitHub repository:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("phylotastic/datelife")
```

## Quick intro

You can update the cached objects with the `update_all_cached()` function.


## Citation

If you use `datelife` for a publication, please cite the R package and the accompanying paper:

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
print(citation("datelife"), bibtex = FALSE, style = "html")
```

You can get these citations and the bibtex entry with:
```{r eval = FALSE}
citation("datelife")
toBibtex(citation("datelife"))
```

## Feedback and Information for Developers

All comments, ideas and questions about `datelife` are encouraged. You are welcome
to post an issue [here](https://github.com/phylotastic/datelife/issues/new), or
to make a [pull request](https://github.com/phylotastic/datelife/pulls) if you
want to contribute with code directly.

#### Function documentation:

Package and function documentation was generated with [roxygen2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=roxygen2):

```{r eval = FALSE}
roxygen2::roxygenise()
```

#### Styling code:

We used the package [lintr]() to check for coding style:

```{r eval = FALSE}
lintr::lint_package()
```

#### Calculating test coverage:

Code coverage was tested with the package [covr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=covr):

```{r eval = FALSE}
cov <- covr::package_coverage()

usethis::use_data(cov, overwrite = TRUE)
```

You can see an interactive report of testing coverage:

```{r eval = FALSE}
covr::report(cov)
```

And, find code with zero coverage:

```{r eval = FALSE}
covr::zero_coverage(cov)
```

#### Releasing to CRAN:

To create the CRAN release, first run a `R CMD check` from your terminal.
For that, change directories to the one above your package:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd ../
```

Generate a tar ball for your package by running `R CMD build`:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
R CMD build datelife
```

Finally, run `R CMD check` on the tar ball that you just generated:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
R CMD check datelife_0.5.0.tar.gz
```


#### Generating `datelife`'s hexsticker:

Code used to generate current `datelife`'s hexsticker is in [data-raw/hexsticker-current.R](data-raw/hexsticker-current.R)

#### Rendering the vignettes:

```{r eval = FALSE}
knitr::knit("vignettes/Getting_started_with_datelife.Rmd")
```
