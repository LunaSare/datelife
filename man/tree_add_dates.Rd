\title{Fabricates dates of missing taxa (with no data) on an already dated tree.}
\usage{
tree_add_dates(dated_tree = NULL, missing_taxa = NULL,
  dating_method = "mrbayes", adding_criterion = "random",
  mrbayes_output_file = "mrbayes_tree_add_dates.nexus")
}
\arguments{
\item{dated_tree}{a tree (newick or phylo) with branch lengths proportional to absolute time}

\item{missing_taxa}{A tree, a data frame or a vector enlisting all missing taxa you want to include.
\describe{

    \item{A tree.}{Either as a phylo object or as a newick character string.
    It contains all taxa that you want at the end, both missing and non missing.
    This tree will be used as a hard constraint.
}
    \item{A data frame.}{It contains two columns.
    taxon. A character vector of missing taxon names.
    clade. A character or numeric vector of nodes from a constraint tree to which each taxon will be assigned.
}
    \item{A character vector.}{It contains the names of the missing taxa.
    They will be added at random to the constraint tree.
}
}}

\item{dating_method}{The method used for tree dating.}

\item{adding_criterion}{Only valid when dating_method = "mrbayes". A character vector to specify how missing_taxa should be added to dated_tree.
     Choose one of:
\describe{
\item{adding_method = "random"}{missing_taxa will be added at random to dated_tree.
}
\item{adding_method = "taxonomy"}{taxa will be added to dated_tree following a dataframe with taxonomic assignations given in missing_taxa argument. If no dataframe is given, OToLs reference taxonomy will be used.
}
\item{adding_method = "tree"}{taxa will be added to dated_tree following a tree given in missing_taxa argument. If no tree is given, OToL synthetic tree will be used.
}
}}

\item{mrbayes_output_file}{A character vector specifying the name of mrBayes run file and outputs (can specify directory too).}
}
\value{
A phylo object
}
