\title{Eliminates unmatched (NAs) and invalid taxa from a rotl::tnrs_match_names or datelife::tnrs_match output
Useful to get ott ids to retrieve an otol induced subtree from.
Needed because using include_suppressed = FALSE in tnrs_match_names does not drop all invalid taxa}
\usage{
clean_tnrs(tnrs, invalid = c("barren", "extinct", "uncultured",
  "major_rank_conflict", "incertae", "unplaced", "conflict",
  "environmental", "not_otu"), remove_nonmatches = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tnrs}{A data frame, usually an output from datelife::tnrs_match or rotl::tnrs_match_names functions, but see details.}

\item{invalid}{A character string with flags to be removed from final object.}

\item{remove_nonmatches}{Boolean, whether to remove unssuccesfully matched names or not.}
}
\value{
A data frame or named list (depending on the input) with valid taxa only.
