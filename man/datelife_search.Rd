\usage{
datelife_search(
  input = c("Rhea americana", "Pterocnemia pennata", "Struthio camelus"),
  summary_format = "phylo_all",
  partial = TRUE,
  use_tnrs = FALSE,
  approximate_match = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{One of the following:
\describe{
\item{Taxon names}{As a character vector.}
\item{One or more trees with taxon names as tip labels}{As a \code{phylo} or \code{multiPhylo}
object, OR as a newick character string.}
\item{A \code{datelifeQuery} object}{An output from \code{\link[=make_datelife_query]{make_datelife_query()}}
\code{\link[=make_datelife_query]{make_datelife_query}}.}
}}

\item{summary_format}{A character vector of length one, indicating the output
format for results of the DateLife search. Available output formats are:
\describe{
\item{"citations"}{A character vector of references where chronograms with
some or all of the target taxa are published (source chronograms).}
\item{"mrca"}{A named numeric vector of most recent common ancestor (mrca)
ages of target taxa defined in input, obtained from the source chronograms.
Names of mrca vector are equal to citations.}
\item{"newick_all"}{A named character vector of newick strings corresponding
to target chronograms derived from source chronograms. Names of newick_all
vector are equal to citations.}
\item{"newick_sdm"}{Only if multiple source chronograms are available. A
character vector with a single newick string corresponding to a target
chronogram obtained with SDM supertree method (Criscuolo et al. 2006).}
\item{"newick_median"}{Only if multiple source chronograms are available.
A character vector with a single newick string corresponding to a target
chronogram from the median of all source chronograms.}
\item{"phylo_sdm"}{Only if multiple source chronograms are available. A
phylo object with a single target chronogram obtained with SDM supertree
method (Criscuolo et al. 2006).}
\item{"phylo_median"}{Only if multiple source chronograms are available. A
phylo object with a single target chronogram obtained from source
chronograms with median method.}
\item{"phylo_all"}{A named list of phylo objects corresponding to each target
chronogram obtained from available source chronograms. Names of
phylo_all list correspond to citations.}
\item{"phylo_biggest"}{The chronogram with the most taxa. In the case of a
tie, the chronogram with clade age closest to the median age of the
equally large trees is returned.}
\item{"html"}{A character vector with an html string that can be saved and
then opened in any web browser. It contains a 4 column table with data on
target taxa: mrca, number of taxa, citations of source chronogram and
newick target chronogram.}
\item{"data_frame"}{A data frame with data on target taxa: mrca, number of
taxa, citations of source chronograms and newick string.}
}}

\item{partial}{Boolean; default to \code{TRUE}: use source trees even if they only
match some of the desired taxa.}

\item{cache}{A character vector of length one, with the name of the data object
to cache. Default to \code{"opentree_chronograms"}, a data object storing Open Tree of
Life's database chronograms and other associated information.}

\item{summary_print}{A character vector specifying type of summary information
to be printed to screen:
\describe{
\item{"citations"}{Prints references of chronograms where target taxa are found.}
\item{"taxa"}{Prints a summary of the number of chronograms where each target
taxon is found.}
\item{"none"}{Nothing is printed to screen.}
}
Default to \code{c("citations", "taxa")}, which displays both.}

\item{taxon_summary}{A character vector specifying if data on target taxa missing
in source chronograms should be added to the output as a \code{"summary"} or as a
presence/absence \code{"matrix"}. Default to \code{"none"}, no information on taxon_summary
added to the output.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, it gives printed updates to the user.}

\item{criterion}{Whether to get the grove with the most trees or the most taxa}

\item{update_opentree_chronograms}{default to \code{FALSE}}
}
\description{
\code{datelife_search} is the core DateLife function to find and
get all openly available, peer-reviewed scientific information on time of
lineage divergence for a set \code{input} taxon names given as a character
vector, a newick character string, or a \code{phylo} or \code{multiPhylo} object.
}
\details{
If only one taxon names is given as \code{input}, \code{get_spp_from_taxon} is
always set to \code{TRUE}.
For approaches that return a single synthetic tree, it is important that the
trees leading to it form a grove (roughly, a sufficiently overlapping set of
taxa between trees: see An√© et al. 2005, 10.1007/s00026-009-0017-x). In the
rare case of multiple groves, should we take the one with the most trees or
the most taxa?

\examples{
# obtain median ages from a set of source chronograms in newick format:
ages <- datelife_search(c(
  "Rhea americana", "Pterocnemia pennata", "Struthio camelus",
  "Mus musculus"
), summary_format = "newick_median")
# save the tree in newick format
write(ages, file = "some.bird.ages.txt")

# obtain median ages from a set of source chronograms in phylo format
# will produce same tree as above but in r phylo format:
ages.again <- datelife_search(c(
  "Rhea americana", "Pterocnemia pennata", "Struthio camelus",
  "Mus musculus"
), summary_format = "phylo_median")
plot(ages.again)

)$xx) * 0.5))
write.tree(ages.again, file = "some.bird.tree.again.txt") # saves phylo object in newick format

# obtain mrca ages and target chronograms from all source chronograms
# generate an html  output readable in any web browser:
ages.html <- datelife_search(c(
  "Rhea americana", "Pterocnemia pennata", "Struthio camelus",
  "Mus musculus"
), summary_format = "html")
