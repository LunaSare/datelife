\title{Summarize an output from get_datelife_result function
Get different types of summaries from a datelifeResult object.
A datelifeResult object is a named list of patristic matrcies.
This allows rapid processing of data.
If you need a list of chronograms from your datelifeResult object, this is the function you are looking for.}
\usage{
summarize_datelife_result(
  datelife_result = NULL,
  datelife_query = NULL,
  summary_format = "phylo_all",
  partial = TRUE,
  update_opentree_chronograms = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{datelife_result}{An output of get_datelife_result function: A list of patristic matrices with names corresponding to original study citations.}

\item{datelife_query}{A datelifeQuery object, output of make_datelife_query function}

\item{summary_format}{The desired output format for target chronograms (chronograms of target taxa). See details.}

\item{partial}{Boolean; default to TRUE: use source trees even if they only match some of the desired taxa.}

\item{update_opentree_chronograms}{default to FALSE}

\item{cache}{A character vector of length one, with the name of the data object to cache. Default to "opentree_chronograms", a data object storing Open Tree of Life's database chronograms and other associated information.}

\item{summary_print}{A character vector specifying type of summary information to be printed: "citations" for the references of chronograms from cache where target taxa are found, "taxa" for a summary of the number of chronograms where each target taxon is found, or "none" if nothing should be printed. Default to display both c("citations", "taxa").}

\item{taxon_summary}{A character vector specifying if data on target taxa missing in source chronograms should be added to the output as a "summary" or as a presence/absence "matrix". Default to "none", no information on taxon_summary added to the output.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. If TRUE, it gives printed updates to the user.}

\item{criterion}{Whether to get the grove with the most trees or the most taxa}

\details{
Available output formats are:

citations: A character vector of references where chronograms with some or all of the target taxa are published (source chronograms).

mrca: A named numeric vector of most recent common ancestor (mrca) ages of target taxa defined in input, obtained from the source chronograms. Names of mrca vector are equal to citations.

newick_all: A named character vector of newick strings corresponding to target chronograms derived from source chronograms. Names of newick_all vector are equal to citations.

newick_sdm: Only if multiple source chronograms are available. A character vector with a single newick string corresponding to a target chronogram obtained with SDM supertree method (Criscuolo et al. 2006).

newick_median: Only if multiple source chronograms are available. A character vector with a single newick string corresponding to a target chronogram from the median of all source chronograms.

phylo_sdm: Only if multiple source chronograms are available. A phylo object with a single target chronogram obtained with SDM supertree method (Criscuolo et al. 2006).

phylo_median: Only if multiple source chronograms are available. A phylo object with a single target chronogram obtained from source chronograms with median method.

phylo_all: A named list of phylo objects corresponding to each target chronogram obtained from available source chronograms. Names of phylo_all list correspond to citations.

phylo_biggest: The chronogram with the most taxa. In the case of a tie, the chronogram with clade age closest to the median age of the equally large trees is returned.

html: A character vector with an html string that can be saved and then opened in any web browser. It contains a 4 column table with data on target taxa: mrca, number of taxa, citations of source chronogram and newick target chronogram.

data_frame A data frame with data on target taxa: mrca, number of taxa, citations of source chronograms and newick string.

For approaches that return a single synthetic tree, it is important that the trees leading to it form a grove (roughly, a sufficiently overlapping set of taxa between trees: see An√© et al. 2005, 10.1007/s00026-009-0017-x). In the rare case of multiple groves, should we take the one with the most trees or the most taxa?
